# NormativeModeling_SulcalWidth_SZ
This repository contains all the code developed for a biomedical engineering thesis focused on the analysis of cortical sulcal width in schizophrenia using normative modeling. The project investigates structural brain alterations by quantifying deviations in sulcal width across 40 cortical regions in a large multi-site dataset of healthy controls and patients. It integrates data preprocessing, normative modeling (Bayesian linear regression with warping), statistical group comparisons, network-based analyses (hub vulnerability and epicenters), and visualization of morphometric patterns. All analyses aim to improve our understanding of schizophrenia-related structural brain deviations through a computational psychiatry approach.
